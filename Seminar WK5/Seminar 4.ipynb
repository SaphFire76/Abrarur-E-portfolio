    "\n",
    "Then the code worked but when I checked the received_file it had no data. I could tell that the 'with open('received_file.txt', 'wb') as f:' line cleared the data already in the received_file but it was unable to successfully write the data to the file. I was sure that the problem was server side as I received a 'File received!' message, which was also echoed to the client. To confirm the problem was server side i printed the data before writing it to the received_file, and the data was printed as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The received_file was definitely being opened because 'with open('received_file.txt', 'wb') as f:' opens the file and clears it. The problem seems to be with the f.write().\n",
    "\n",
    "After a lot of tinkering, it seems like moving the 'data, client_address = server_socket.recvfrom(2048)' outside the 'with open('received_file.txt', 'wb') as f:' works. One hypothesis is that the having 'data, client_address = server_socket.recvfrom(2048)' in 'with open('received_file.txt', 'wb') as f:' causes 'server_socket.recvfrom(2048)' to be ran repeatedly causing empty data to be fetched from the client which then overwrites the received_file contents."
